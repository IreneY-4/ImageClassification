# ImageClassification

Master Assignment Project:
the objective is to develop a classification solution using classical machine
learning methods (solving an object recognition task). Each object is represented 
by a 28x28 dimensional image in a single 'flattened' 784 dimensional vector with 
an associated label (+1 or -1)
